p3Intro = "Welcome to the Offensive Strategies section of the application, where we will analyze the ingenous ways militaries in the Middle Ages evolved to breach heavily-armed bastions and lay waste to their enemies."

p3Img1 = "images/siegeMachines.webp"
p3MachineData = [
    "- Siege engines were powerful mechanical devices designed to assist in the assault or defense of fortified structures during sieges. These machines were essential in medieval warfare, particularly during the Crusades, where capturing or defending castles, cities, and fortresses was a primary objective. Siege engines varied in size, complexity, and function, but they all shared the common goal of breaching or overcoming the defensive works of the enemy.",
        "- These machines could hurl projectiles, including rocks, stones, and incendiary devices, at high velocity, inflicting damage and causing destruction to defensive structures",
            "- An example was the Trebuchet. The trebuchet was one of the most iconic siege engines of the medieval period. It consisted of a large pivoted arm with a sling or bucket at one end and a counterweight at the other. The trebuchet could hurl projectiles, such as rocks, stones, or even diseased carcasses, with great force and accuracy. Trebuchets were capable of inflicting significant damage to fortifications and were instrumental in breaching enemy walls during sieges.",
                "- Another fantastic instance of military engineering was the siege tower. The siege tower was a mobile wooden structure equipped with ladders or ramps that allowed attackers to gain access to the upper levels of enemy walls. Siege towers provided cover and protection for assaulting troops as they approached the walls, enabling them to engage in hand-to-hand combat with defenders and potentially breach the defenses. Siege towers were often equipped with archers or other ranged weapons to provide covering fire for the advancing troops."
]           

p3Img2 = "images/sieging.webp"
p3SiegeData = [
    "- During Medieval Times, there was more to sieging a city than surrounding it and waiting until they run out of supplies and thus surrender. It was a multistep process that involved careful planning and preparation. This involved gathering intelligence about the city's defenses, terrain, and surrounding geography. Then, the army commanders would assess the strengths and weaknesses of the target, determine the optimal approach for the siege, and develop a comprehensive strategy to achieve their objectives.",
        "- The first step in a siege was often to establish an encirclement or blockade around the city, known as an investment. This involved positioning troops, constructing defensive works, and deploying siege engines to prevent the entry or exit of supplies, reinforcements, and messengers. The goal of the investment was to isolate the city and cut off its communication and supply lines, weakening its defenses and wearing down the morale of its inhabitants.",
            "- Siege engines also played a crucial role in a successful operation. Siege engineers and craftsmen were responsible for designing, building, and operating these machines, which required precision, skill, and coordination to be effective. Fun fact: the majority of siege engines were built on site. I thought this was pretty funny because it acted essentially like a warning sign to the enemy \"Hello! Please wait for me to build this massive battering ram so I can break your fortress wall. Please don't do anything in the meantime. Thank you!\"",
                "- Blockading the city and starving its inhabitants was a common strategy to compel surrender. By cutting off the city's food, water, and essential supplies, besiegers could inflict suffering and hardship on the population, weakening their resolve and forcing them to capitulate. Blockades could be maintained using naval patrols, land-based checkpoints, and fortifications to prevent the entry or exit of goods and people."
]

p3Img3 = "images/sappers.jpg"
p3SapperData = [
    "- Sapping was a siege tactic commonly employed during the medieval period, particularly from the 11th to the 13th centuries. It involved the digging of trenches, tunnels, or mines close to the enemy walls in order to undermine them or gain closer proximity for assaults. Sapping allowed besieging forces to approach the defensive structures of a city or fortress safely, minimizing exposure to enemy fire and maximizing the effectiveness of subsequent attacks.",
        "- Sappers would sometimes reinforce the excavated passages with wooden supports to prevent collapse and maintain stability. Then, the saps would be dug deep enough to pass beneath the foundations of the walls, allowing attackers to undermine their structural integrity and potentially cause them to collapse.",
            "- The life of a sapper was very dangerous, since the enemy would send counter-sappers and if they dug into each other's tunnels, a bloodbath would ensue.",
                "- A good defense against the undermining technique was to surround your castle with a moat, so that the enemy sapper's tunnels would fill with water if they attempted to undermine your defenses."

p4Intro = "Welcome to the Defensive Strategies section of the application. In this section, we will examine the various defensive technologies that the defenders of these great bastions used to protect against invaders."

p4Img1 = "images/constantinople.webp"
p4PositionData = [
    "- The most important defense mechanism was to have a good location of the city or castle. Building cities where natural defenses such as lakes, rivers, oceans, or the top of a mountain are located creates a scenario where the enemy has to overcome these natural defenses before attacking your city, slowing down or even effectively stopping the invasion entirely.",
        "- An example of good strategic positioning would be the location of Medieval Constantinople. Situated on the narrow strip of land between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, with the Bosporus Strait to the east and the Golden Horn inlet to the north, Constantinople was naturally protected by water on three sides.",
            "- The rugged terrain surrounding Constantinople, including hills, cliffs, and rocky terrain, further enhanced its defensive capabilities. The city's elevated position provided defenders with commanding views of the surrounding countryside, allowing them to observe enemy movements and coordinate defensive actions more effectively. The rugged coastline and steep cliffs along the shores of the Golden Horn and the Bosporus made amphibious assaults challenging for would-be invaders, limiting the options for direct attacks on the city from the sea."
]

p4Img2 = "images/theodosian.webp"
p4WallsData = [
    "- Strong defensive structures, such as walls, towers, and gates, were built around cities and castles to deter attackers and withstand assaults. These defensives were also built with slits and holes for the archers to shoot arrows at the attacking soldiers. Theses defensive positions also featured overlapping fields of fire. Overlapping fields of fire is a military strategy commonly employed in defensive positions, including during medieval times, to maximize the effectiveness of defensive firepower against enemy attackers. The concept involves positioning defensive units and weapons in such a way that they can cover each other's sectors of fire, creating a zone where multiple defensive positions converge to engage enemy forces.",
        "- Overlapping fields of fire ensure that defensive positions provide mutual support and coverage, allowing adjacent units to engage enemy targets from different angles and directions. By coordinating their fire, defenders can concentrate their firepower on specific areas of the battlefield, effectively suppressing enemy advances and inflicting casualties.", 
            "- While having many archers stationed along the wall shooting in all directions to prevent the enemy from advancing, one of its weaknesses is that there is a blind spot where the archers are unable to shoot at the enemy. This blind spot spans a right angle from where the archer is positioned. Enemies would be able to rush directly into the blind spot and dig at the walls to create gaps. Defenders found a way to counter these blind spots by building hoarding along the top and frontside of these wall fortifications allowing the archers to position themselves in an elevated area high up and in front of these walls. With this modification, defenders are able to shoot down or pour burning liquid on the sappers that attempt to pick at their walls. ",
                "- Another method that was used to counter this blind spot, as well as innovate the idea of hoarding was to create towers in these walls to allow for horizontal flanking. Archer slots would be fitted onto the sides of the tower instead of the usual front, allowing the defenders to shoot horizontally."
]

p4Img3 = "images/defend.webp"
p4DefendData = [
    "- If the enemy decides to siege the city, the defender must always be prepared with ample supplies and the logistics to outlast the siege and have enough morale from the army to overwhelm the invaders. How were the defenders able to achieve a steady source of supplies? Supply lines. Supply lines were established to transport goods from sources of production, such as agricultural regions or supply depots, to the frontlines where they were needed. This often involved organizing convoys of wagons or pack animals to transport supplies overland, as well as utilizing maritime routes for transporting goods by sea.",
        "- Resupplying and reinforcing besieged fortifications or distant armies required careful coordination and planning. Relief forces had to navigate through enemy-controlled territory or bypass hostile obstacles to reach their destination. Supply convoys were often accompanied by armed escorts to defend against ambushes or raids by enemy forces seeking to disrupt the flow of provisions. Successful resupply operations were essential for sustaining the morale and combat effectiveness of besieged defenders or isolated garrisons.", 
            "- Medieval warfare presented numerous logistical challenges, including adverse weather conditions, rugged terrain, limited infrastructure, and the threat of enemy interception. Supply lines were vulnerable to disruption from enemy raids, guerrilla attacks, or natural disasters, which could disrupt the flow of provisions and weaken the logistical support for military operations. Overcoming these challenges required careful planning, flexibility, and resourcefulness on the part of military commanders and logisticians."

    "- Not only will the water slow the enemies attacks, I also positioned the castle to be on top of a hill next to the water as well, allowing for defensive archers to shoot flaming arrows at the attacker's wooden ships. Even if the attackers decide to jump overboard, swimming is slower than running, therefore they will be easy targets for my archers to pick off.",
    "- Because of the fact that I am surrounded by water on 3 sides, I will only have one front to focus on. However, with my advantageous position of being on top of a hill, the attackers will have a hard time sieging the city because their siege machines will not function correctly on an uneven, tilted surface.",
